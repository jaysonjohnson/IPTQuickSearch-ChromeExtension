Once on this page, check “Developer mode” to enable loading unpacked extensions. This will allow you to load your extension from a folder. 

Finally, click “Load unpacked extension” or simply drag the “IPTQuickSearch-ChromeExtension” folder onto the page to load up the extension. You should immediately see the extension show up as a Browser Action with your icon in the toolbar window of the current tab.

In the popup simply type in a search term and click "Search" button.
